Zotero Checklist
================

# SEFSC Coworking session August 17 2022: Zotero, Quarto and Github

# Getting started

1.  Go to Zotero
    -   Create an account

    -   Download and install Zotero
2.  Add your references
    -   Drag and drop from folder

    -   Import from Mendeley (online seems to work best)

        -   File/import

        -   ![](figures/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-17%20at%2011.27.45%20AM.png)

    -   Use DOI to include reference

    -   Add from browser
3.  Join a group
    -   [SEDAR](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4750864/sedar/library)

# Drawbacks

1.  Repository limit of 100 MB

-   (2GB of storage for a year is \$20, unsure if it works)

2.  Gray literature, papers with no DOI or scanned

-   NB: can SEDAR have DOI issued to reports?
-   Manual work involved

# Integrating Zotero and Quarto

Note: I am in a Mac, using the latest version of RStudio (2022.07.1
Build 554)
