1.  Go to Zotero

-   Create an account

-   Download and install Zotero

2.  Add your references

-   Drag and drop from folder

-   Import from Mendeley (online seems to work best)

-   File/import

-   ![](figures/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-17%20at%2011.27.45%20AM.png)

-   Use DOI to include reference

-   Add from browser

3.  Join a group

-   [SEDAR](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4750864/sedar/library)

# Drawbacks

1.  Repository limit of 100 MB

-   (2GB of storage for a year is \\\$20, unsure if it works)

2.  Gray literature, papers with no DOI or scanned

-   NB: can SEDAR have DOI issued to reports?

-   Manual work involved

# Integrating Zotero and Quarto

Note: I am in a Mac, using the latest version of RStudio (2022.07.1 Build 554)

1.  Rstudio - Preferences - RMarkdown - Citations
